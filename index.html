    <h3>This chatbot is an interactive game based on Discord, specifically designed to guess musical instruments the user is thinking of. At its core is a carefully crafted decision tree consisting of a series of yes/no questions to guide the user step-by-step towards their thought-of instrument.

    At the start of the game, the bot poses a root question: "Does the instrument produce sound by air vibration?" The user's answer determines the next step in the game. A "Yes" leads to exploring wind instruments, while a "No" shifts the focus to other types of instruments such as string or percussion instruments.
        
    Following this, the bot continues with more specific questions, like "Is the instrument made of metal?" or "Is it usually held in the hands while playing?" Each question is associated with specific instrument guesses, such as Trumpet, Flute, Guitar, Cello, Saxophone, etc. In this way, each choice made by the user leads them down different branches of the decision tree, culminating in the bot making a guess about the instrument.
        
    If the bot's guess is incorrect, users have the opportunity to provide new information about the instrument and a distinguishing question via a feedback form, enriching and updating the content of the decision tree. This interaction not only provides entertainment but also makes the game educational, helping users learn and understand different types of musical instruments.
        
    Utilizing Python's Discord library, this bot creates and manages interactions on Discord, including sending messages, processing user responses, and updating the game's state. Overall, the game is both fun and educational, capable of growing and improving with user participation, offering an interactive and informative gaming experience</h3>
